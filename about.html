            As a college student with a passion for technology, I've developed a
            diverse skill set that encompasses several programming languages and
            web development. Let me share a bit about my knowledge and
            experience in each area:

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3 id="heading-pro">C Programming:</h3>
          <p class="desc_pro">
            C is where my journey in programming began. It is a powerful and
            foundational language, known for its efficiency and versatility.
            I've honed my skills in C by tackling algorithmic challenges,
            developing console-based applications, and gaining a deep
            understanding of memory management. Working with C has taught me the
            importance of precision and optimization in coding, which has
            influenced my approach to other languages as well.
          </p>

          <h3 id="heading-pro">C++ Programming:</h3>
          <p class="desc_pro">
            Building upon my knowledge of C, I ventured into C++, a popular
            object-oriented extension of C. With C++, I've explored the
            principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows me to
            design modular and reusable code. My experience with C++ includes
            developing desktop applications, implementing data structures and
            algorithms, and leveraging its robust standard library to enhance
            the functionality of my projects.
          </p>

          <h3 id="heading-pro">Java:</h3>
          <p class="desc_pro">
            Java is another language I've delved into extensively. Renowned for
            its "write once, run anywhere" capability, Java has opened up the
            world of cross-platform development to me. I've worked on various
            Java projects, including Android app development, web applications
            using Java Servlets, and backend services using Spring Framework.
            Java's object-oriented nature and robust ecosystem have enabled me
            to create scalable and efficient solutions.
          </p>

          <h3 id="heading-pro">Python:</h3>
          <p class="desc_pro">
            Python holds a special place in my heart as a versatile and
            beginner-friendly language. I've used Python in a wide range of
            applications, from data analysis and machine learning to scripting
            and web scraping. Its readability and expressiveness make it an
            excellent choice for prototyping and building quick solutions. I am
            continuously exploring Python libraries and frameworks, such as
            NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Django, to enhance my capabilities in
            data science and web development.
          </p>

          <h3 id="heading-pro">Web Development:</h3>
          <p class="desc_pro">
            Web development has been a fascinating journey for me, as it allows
            me to blend my programming skills with creativity to build
            interactive and dynamic websites. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, the core trio that forms the foundation of web
            development. I've created responsive and visually appealing
            websites, incorporating modern web technologies and frameworks like
            React and Node.js. Understanding both front-end and back-end
            development has enabled me to design full-stack web applications.
